\label{sec:proposal}

In this section, we present \RPCBROADCAST, a causal broadcast protocol removing
the last linear upper bound in terms of number of processes that ever broadcast
a message that remained on space complexity. \RPCBROADCAST exploits the
improvement brought by \PCBROADCAST on generated traffic to reduce the space
consumed by reliable broadcast, at marginal cost.
