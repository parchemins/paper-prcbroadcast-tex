  Causal broadcast constitutes the core communication primitive of many
  distributed systems. For decades, state-of-the-art approaches relied on
  maintaining and transmitting vector clocks. The size of vector clocks increase
  linearly with the number of processes that ever joined the systems. Causal
  broadcast eventually became overcostly and inefficient in large and dynamic
  systems.  A recent approach solved the main issue about generated traffic by
  removing the need for transmitting vectors. However, the maintenance
