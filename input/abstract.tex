  Causal broadcast constitutes a fundamental communication primitive of many
  distributed protocols and applications. However, state-of-the-art
  implementations fail to forget obsolete control information about already
  delivered messages. They do not scale in large and dynamic systems.  In this
  paper, we propose a novel implementation of causal broadcast.  We prove that
  all and only obsolete control information is safely removed, at cost of a few
  lightweight control messages. The local space complexity of this protocol does
  not monotonically increase and depends at each moment on the number of
  messages still in transit and the degree of the communication graph. Moreover,
  messages only carry a scalar clock.  Our implementation constitutes a
  sustainable communication primitive for causal broadcast in large and dynamic
  systems.
