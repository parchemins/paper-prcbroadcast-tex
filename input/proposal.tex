\label{sec:proposal}

In this section, we present \RPCBROADCAST, a causal broadcast protocol removing
the last linear upper bound in terms of number of processes that ever broadcast
a message that remained on space complexity. \RPCBROADCAST exploits the
improvement brought by \PCBROADCAST on generated traffic to reduce the space
consumed by reliable broadcast, at marginal cost.

\subsection{Model}

A distributed systems comprises a set of processes that can communicate with
each other using messages.

\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Operation}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:rpcbroadcast} shows the instructions of the proposed causal
broadcast. It relies on an implementation of reliable broadcast shown in
Algorithm~\ref{algo:reliablebroadcast}. When the process does not add links to
other processes, nor other processes add links to this process, causal broadcast
operation is that of reliable broadcast.

When the process wants to add a link to another process for causal broadcast, it
makes sure that this link cannot break the guaranty that the other process
delivers each message exactly once in causal order.
