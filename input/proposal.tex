\label{sec:proposal}

In this section, we present a causal broadcast protocol providing a novel
trade-off between speed, memory, and traffic. Among others, it safely removes
obsolete control information about broadcast messages.  Its memory consumption
increases and decreases over receipts. The key ideas are:
\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
\item Every process broadcasts or forwards a message once, hence every link
  carries a message once. A process expects to receive as many copies of a
  message as its number of links. Once a process received all expected copies,
  it can forget about this broadcast message, i.e., it can safely remove the
  control information associated to this broadcast message.
\item Adding links between pair of processes adds uncertainty. The receiver
  cannot state any longer when it should expect a message from a link.
\item By exploiting causal order, processes remove this uncertainty. Causal
  order allows processes to remove batches of obsolete information while
  reasoning about temporarily buffered broadcast messages.
\end{inparaenum}

\subsection{Model}

A distributed system comprises a set of processes that can communicate with each
other using messages. Processes may not have the knowledge of all processes in
the system. Instead, processes build and maintain overlay networks: each process
updates a local partial view of logical communication links, i.e., a set of
processes to communicate with. The partial view is usually much smaller than the
actual system size. We use the terms of overlay networks, and distributed
systems interchangeably.

\begin{definition}[Overlay network]
  An overlay network $G = (P,\, E)$ comprises a set of processes $P$ and a set
  of directed links $E \subseteq P \times P$.  An overlay network is static if
  both sets $P$ and $E$ are immutable. Otherwise, the overlay network is
  dynamic. An overlay network is strongly connected if there exists a path --
  i.e. a link or an sequence of links -- from any process to any other
  process. We only consider strongly connected overlay networks.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Process]
  A process runs a set of instructions sequentially. Processes communicate with
  each other using asynchronous message passing. A process~A can send a message
  to a process~B $s_{AB}(m)$, or to any process $s_A(m)$; receive a message from
  a process~B $r_{AB}(m)$, or from any process $r_A(m)$. A process sends
  messages using the set of links departing from it, called out-view
  $Q_o$. Processes reachable via these links are called neighbors.  A process
  receives messages from the set of links arriving to it, called in-view $Q_i$.
  Processes are faulty if they crash, otherwise they are correct. We do not
  consider Byzantine processes.
\end{definition}

Causal broadcast ensures properties similar to those of reliable broadcast. Each
process may receive each broadcast message multiple times but delivers it
once. In this paper, we tackle the issue of implementing these properties.
% receives each broadcast message at least once, and delivers it once despite
% possible multiple receipts.

\begin{definition}[\label{def:reliablebroadcast}Uniform reliable broadcast] 
  When a process~A broadcasts a message to all processes of its system $b_A(m)$,
  each correct process~B eventually receives it and delivers it
  $d_B(m)$. Uniform reliable broadcast guarantees 3 properties:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(1)]
  \item Validity: If a correct process broadcasts a message, then it
    eventually delivers it.
  \item Uniform Agreement: If a process -- correct or not -- delivers a message,
    then all correct processes eventually deliver it.
  \item Uniform Integrity: A process delivers a message at most once, and only if
    it was previously broadcast.
  \end{inparaenum}
\end{definition}

In static systems, implementing these properties only requires a local structure
the size of which grows and shrinks over receipts~\cite{raynal2013distributed}.
Every process knows the number of copies of each delivered message it should
expect. When this number drops down to $0$, the process safely removes the
control information associated to the delivered messages. This forbids multiple
delivery for the process will never receive -- hence deliver -- this message
again.

However, in dynamic systems where processes join, leave, or self-reconfigure
their out-view at any time, the removal of a link may impair the consistency of
the number of expected messages. Either processes cannot safely garbage collect
obsolete control information, or processes suffer from multiple delivery.

In this paper, we solve this issue by exploiting causal broadcast's ability to
ensure a specific order on message delivery. To characterize the order among
events such as send, or receive, we define time in a logical sense using
Lamportâ€™s definition.

\begin{definition}[Happens-before~\cite{lamport1978time}]
  The happens-before relationship defines a strict partial order of events. The
  happens-before relationship $\rightarrow$ is transitive
  ($e_1 \rightarrow e_2 \wedge e_2 \rightarrow e_3 \implies e_1 \rightarrow
  e_3$),
  irreflexive ($e_1 \not\rightarrow e_1$), and antisymmetric
  ($e_1 \rightarrow e_2 \implies e_2 \not\rightarrow e_1$).  The sending of a
  message always precedes its receipt $s_{AB}(m) \rightarrow r_{BA}(m)$. Two
  messages are concurrent if none happens before the other
  ($r_A(m_1) \not\rightarrow s_A(m_2) \wedge r_A(m_2) \not\rightarrow s_A(m_1)$).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Causal order]
  The delivery order of messages follows the happen before relationships of the
  corresponding broadcasts.
  $d_A(m) \rightarrow b_A(m') \implies d_B(m) \rightarrow d_B(m')$
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Causal broadcast]
  Causal broadcast is a uniform reliable broadcast ensuring causal order.
\end{definition}

  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


We define link memory as a mean for processes to forbid multiple delivery while
safely removing obsolete control information. Processes attach control
information about expected messages to each link of their respective in-view.


\begin{definition}[\label{def:memory}Link memory]
  Assuming a link $(A,\, B)$, Process~B remembers among its delivered messages
  those that it will receive from this link; and forgets among its delivered
  messages those that it will never receive from this link.
  $remember_{BA}(m) \equiv d_B(m) \wedge \neg r_{BA}(m)$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[Link memory forbids multiple delivery]
  A process that delivers only messages it does not remember using link memory
  delivers each broadcast message exactly once.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  We must show that, for any message $m$, its receipt cannot lead to its
  delivery if a copy of $m$ has already been delivered before:
  $\nexists m,\, d_B(m) \rightarrow r_{BA}(m) \wedge r_{BA}(m) \rightarrow
  d_B(m)$.\\
  The delivery $d_B(m)$ implies a prior receipt $r_B(m) \rightarrow d_B(m)$.
  Assuming that each link carries each messages once, and this receipt comes
  from link $(A,\, B)$, then Process~B cannot receive, hence deliver, $m$ from
  $(A,\, B)$ again:
  $\nexists m,\, r_{BA}(m) \rightarrow d_B(m) \wedge d_B(m) \rightarrow
  r_{BA}(m) \wedge r_{BA}(m) \rightarrow d_{BA}(m)$.\\
  If this receipt comes from any other link $(C,\, B),\, C\neq A$, Process~B
  remembers $m$ on other links, and among others, on link $(A,\, B)$:
  $\forall m,\, r_{BC}(m) \rightarrow remember_{BA}(m)$. Assuming that each link
  carries each message once, Process~B eventually receives a copy of $m$ from
  link $(A,\,B)$: $remember_{BA}(m) \rightarrow r_{BA}(m)$. Since remembering a
  message forbids its delivery, this cannot lead to another
  delivery of $m$: $\nexists m,\, r_{BA}(m) \rightarrow d_{B}(m)$.\\
  Finally, since every process delivers, hence forwards each message once, each
  link carries each messages once.
\end{proof}


\begin{algorithm}[h]
  \input{./input/algoreliablebroadcast.tex}
  \caption{\label{algo:reliablebroadcast}Causal broadcast for static systems.}
\end{algorithm}

Algorithm~\ref{algo:reliablebroadcast} shows a set of instructions that
implements causal broadcast for static systems. It uses reliable FIFO links to
ensure causal order~\cite{friedman2004causal}, and implements link memory
to forbid multiple delivery. Every process maintains a local structure the size
of which increases and decreases over receipts.  The first receipt of a
broadcast message from a link tags the other links (see
Line~\ref{line:remembers}). The receipt on other links of this broadcast message
removes the corresponding tag (see
Line~\ref{line:forgets}). Figure~\ref{fig:memorylink} depicts its functioning in
a system comprising 3 processes. In Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkA}, Process~B
broadcasts $b$. It awaits a copy of $b$ from the only link in its in-view. In
Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkB}, Process~A receives $b$. It delivers it, for no
link in its in-view is tagged with $b$, meaning this is a first receipt. It tags
the other link in its in-view with $b$ and forwards $b$ to its out-view. In
Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkC}, Process~B receives the awaited copy of $b$ from
Process~A. It removes the corresponding entry. The broadcast protocol at
Process~B does not consume space anymore. Process~C receives $b$. It detects a
first receipt so it delivers and forwards $b$. It does not tag any link, for the
only link from its in-view is the link from which it just received $b$. In
Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkD}, the last process to await a copy of $b$ finally
receives it. None of processes remembers about $b$. No copy of $b$ travels in
the system. This implementation forbids multiple delivery in static systems
while safely removing obsolete control information.

  \end{center}
\end{figure*}




However, implementing link memory becomes more challenging in dynamic
systems where processes can start sending messages to any other process at any
time. Any process can receive an already forgotten message from any other
process. Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfails} illustrates the issue. In
Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfailsA}, Process~A broadcasts $a$. It expects a copy
from both Process~B and Process~C. In Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfailsB},
Process~C immediately receives, delivers, and forwards $a$. It does not tag any
link and expects to never receive this message again. However, network condition
delays the receipt of $b$ from Process~B. In Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfailsC},
Process~B adds a communication link towards Process~C. Then it receives,
delivers, and forwards $b$. Since Process~C now belongs to its out-view, the
forwarding includes Process~C. In Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfailsD}, Process~C
receives $a$ again. However, it did not keep control information about this
message. It mistakes it for a first receipt. It delivers and forwards $a$. Not
only Process~C suffers multiple delivery but this has cascading effects over the
whole system.

The rest of this section describes how causal broadcast can exploit causal order
to initialize link memory, an implementation of such broadcast, and its
complexity analysis.


\subsection{Link memory for dynamic systems}

This section demonstrates that causal broadcast can use causal order to
initialize link memory, thereby enabling the use of link memory in dynamic
systems.

Algorithm~\ref{algo:reliablebroadcast} already implements the maintenance of
link memory over receipts. Every process safely removes obsolete control
information over receipts.  However, Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfails} highlights
that new links lack of consistent initialization. The challenge consists in
initializing such memory without history of past messages. Causal broadcast
starts to build the knowledge on-demand, i.e., when a process wants to add a
link to another process.  The protocol disables the new link until
initialized. This initialization requires round-trips of control messages and
message buffering.  Causal broadcast takes advantage of causal order to provide
guarantees on messages included in buffers.

Figure~\ref{fig:timelineproof} depicts the principle of the approach. When a
Process~A adds a link to Process~B, Process~A notifies Process~B using a control
message $\alpha$. This control message $\alpha$, as all control messages that
will follow ($\beta$, $\pi$, $\rho$), must be delivered after all its preceding
messages. Hence, at receipt, Process~B implicitly removes obsolete information:
messages delivered by Process~A before the sending of the notification
$\mathcal{A}_1$.  At receipt of $\alpha$, Process~B can start gathering control
information about its delivered messages in a buffer $B_\alpha$. Among other,
Process~B wants to identify messages concurrent to the correct establishment of
the new link. Process~B acknowledges Process~A's notification using a control
message $\beta$. At receipt of $\beta$, Process~A removes obsolete information:
messages delivered by Process~B before the sending of the acknowledgment
$\mathcal{A}_1 \cup \mathcal{B}_1$. This solves the issue identified in
Figure~\ref{fig:memorylinkfails}, for $a$ would belong to $\mathcal{A}_1$ or
$\mathcal{B}_1$. However, this is not sufficient to initialize link memory.
Process~A sends a control message $\pi$ to Process~B, and starts to gather
control information about its delivered messages in a buffer $B_\beta$. Upon
receipt of $\pi$, Process~B closes its first buffer $B_\alpha$.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{center}
    \input{input/figtimelineproof.tex}
    \caption{\label{fig:timelineproof}\label{fig:timeline}Initializing the link
      memory from Process~A to Process~B. Control messages $\alpha$, $\beta$,
      $\pi$, and $\rho$ are delivered after all preceding messages while
      $B_\beta$ is not. At receipt of $B_\beta$, Process~B classifies the
      messages:
      $B_\beta \cap (B_\alpha \cup B_\pi) = \mathcal{B}_2 \cup \mathcal{A}_3'$
      are messages to ignore;
      $B_\beta \setminus B_\alpha \setminus B_\pi = \mathcal{A}_3\setminus
      \mathcal{A}_3'$
      are messages to deliver; $B_\pi \setminus B_\beta = \mathcal{B}_3$ are
      messages to expect from Process~A.}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


  
\begin{lemma}[\label{lem:balpha}Messages in buffer $B_\alpha$]
  The buffer $B_\alpha$ contains messages delivered by Process~B after the
  sending of $\beta$ and before the receipt of $\pi$.\\
  This includes all messages delivered by Process~A before the sending of $\pi$
  that were not delivered by Process~B before the sending of $\beta$:
  $\mathcal{A}_2$. Above all, this also includes all messages delivered
  by Process~B that were not delivered by Process~A at the sending of $\pi$:
  $\mathcal{B}_2$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Since control messages are delivered after preceding messages,
  % Since causal broadcast ensures causal order among broadcast messages it sends,
  % and control messages are delivered after preceding broadcast messages
  all broadcast messages delivered by Process~A before the sending of $\alpha$
  precede the buffering:
  $\forall m,\, d_A(m) \rightarrow s_A(\alpha_{AB}) \implies m \not \in
  B_\alpha$.
  Since messages are delivered once,
  $\forall m,\, d_A(m) \rightarrow s_A(\pi_{AB}) \wedge d_B(m) \rightarrow
  s_B(\beta_{AB}) \implies m \not \in B_\alpha$.
  This removes $\mathcal{A}_1$ and $\mathcal{B}_1$.\\
  The buffer $B_\alpha$ contains the rest of messages delivered by Process~B
  before the receipt of $\pi$. This includes messages delivered by Process~A
  between the sending of $\alpha$ and $\pi$ but not delivered by Process~B
  before the sending of $\beta$ ($\mathcal{A}_2$); and messages delivered by
  Process~B but not delivered by Process~A before the sending of $\pi$
  ($\mathcal{B}_2$).
\end{proof}

\noindent Upon receipt of $\pi$, Process~B continues to gather control
information about its delivered messages in another buffer $B_\pi$. Some
messages in this buffer will be expected from Process~A, but Process~B cannot
determine which ones just yet. It sends the last acknowledgment $\rho$ to
Process~A. Upon receipt of this acknowledgment, Process~A closes its buffer and
sends it using the new link. Afterwards, Process~A uses the new link for causal
broadcast, for it knows that Process~B will receive $B_\beta$ before upcoming
broadcast messages on this new link, and the receipt of $B_\beta$ will allow
Process~B to initialize this new link memory. \\
\noindent Upon receipt of $B_\beta$, Process~B stops buffering in $B_\pi$.

\begin{lemma}[\label{lem:bbeta}Messages in buffer $B_\beta$]
  The buffer $B_\beta$ contains messages delivered by Process~A after the
  sending of $\pi$ and before the receipt of $\rho$.\\
  This includes all messages delivered by Process~B before the sending of
  $\rho$ that were not delivered by Process~A before the sending of $\pi$:
  $\mathcal{B}_2$. This also includes all messages delivered by Process~A that
  were not delivered by Process~B at the sending of $\rho$: $\mathcal{A}_3$.
\end{lemma}
  
\begin{proof}
  The proof is similar to that of Lemma~\ref{lem:balpha}. Control messages
  shift roles. $\pi$ becomes $\rho$; $\beta$ becomes $\pi$; $\alpha$ becomes
  $\beta$.
\end{proof}
  
\begin{lemma}[\label{lem:bpi}Messages in buffer $B_\pi$]
  The buffer $B_\pi$ contains messages delivered by Process~B after the
  sending of $\pi$ and before the receipt of $B_\beta$.\\
  This may includes messages delivered by Process~A before the sending of
  $B_\beta$ that were not delivered by Process~B before the sending of $\rho$:
  $\mathcal{A}_3'$. This also includes all messages delivered by Process~B that
  were not delivered by Process~A at the sending of $B_\beta$:
  $\mathcal{B}_3$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  The proof is similar to that of Lemmas~\ref{lem:bbeta}~and~\ref{lem:bpi}. The
  difference being that $B_\beta$ is not necessarily delivered after preceding
  messages. Hence, the receipt of $B_\beta$ follows the sending of $\rho$ but
  Process~B cannot state if it received all, part, or none of messages in
  $\mathcal{A}_3$. Thus, $\mathcal{A}_3' \subseteq \mathcal{A}_3$.
\end{proof}

\noindent Using $B_\alpha$, $B_\beta$, and $B_\pi$ buffers, Process~B identifies
messages in $B_\beta$ it must deliver against messages it must ignore, and
messages in $B_\pi$ it must receive from Process~A. This allows Process~B to
initialize link memory.

\begin{theorem}[$B_\alpha$, $B_\beta$, and $B_\pi$ initialize link memory]
  A process consistently initializes link memory at receipt of $B_\beta$ using
  $B_\alpha$ and $B_\pi$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  From Lemma~\ref{lem:balpha}, $B_\alpha = \mathcal{A}_2 \cup \mathcal{B}_2$.
  From Lemma~\ref{lem:bbeta}, $B_\beta= \mathcal{B}_2 \cup \mathcal{A}_3$. From
  Lemma~\ref{lem:bpi}, $B_\pi = \mathcal{A}_3' \cup \mathcal{B}_3$. \\
  First, we must show that Process~B delivers all and only messages from
  $B_\beta$ it did not deliver yet:
  $m \in \mathcal{A}_3 \setminus \mathcal{A}_3'$.\\
  Since
  $B_\beta \setminus B_\alpha \setminus B_\pi = (\mathcal{B}_2 \cup
  \mathcal{A}_3) \setminus (\mathcal{A}_2 \cup \mathcal{B}_2) \setminus
  (\mathcal{A}_3' \cup \mathcal{B}_3) = \mathcal{A}_3 \setminus (\mathcal{A}_3'
  \cup \mathcal{B}_3)$.
  Since $\mathcal{B}_3 \cap \mathcal{A}_3 = \varnothing$, we have
  $B_\beta \setminus B_\alpha \setminus B_\pi = \mathcal{A}_3\setminus
  \mathcal{A}'_3$.\\
  Second, we must show that Process~B initializes the new link memory with all
  and only messages from $B_\pi$ that Process~A did not deliver at the sending
  of $B_\beta$: $m\in \mathcal{B}_3$.\\
  $B_\pi \setminus B_\beta = (\mathcal{A}_3' \cup \mathcal{B}_3) \setminus
  (\mathcal{B}_2 \cup \mathcal{A}_3)$.
  Since $\mathcal{B}_3 \cap \mathcal{B}_2 = \varnothing$ and
  $\mathcal{A}_3' \subseteq \mathcal{A}_3$,
  $B_\pi \setminus (B_\beta \setminus B_\alpha) = \mathcal{B}_3$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Implementation}

\RPCBROADCAST stands for Preventive Reliable Causal broadcast. It prevents both
causal order violations and multiple delivery by using all and only links that
are safe~\cite{nedelec2018pcbroadcast}, and the memory of which is correctly
initialized and maintained. \RPCBROADCAST ensures that control messages are
delivered after all their preceding messages by sending them on reliable FIFO
links used for causal broadcast. \RPCBROADCAST uses a local structure the size
of which increases and decreases over receipts. Every process safely removes
obsolete control information about past broadcast messages.

Algorithm~\ref{algo:rpcbroadcast} shows the instructions of \RPCBROADCAST. 
Figure~\ref{fig:solve} illustrates its operation in a scenario involving 3
processes. In this example, Process~B adds a link to Process~C. Process~B
disables the new link for causal broadcast until it is safe and guaranteed that
Process~C correctly initialized its memory.

\noindent Process~B sends a first control message $\alpha$ to Process~B using
safe links (see Line~\ref{line:sendalpha} and Figure~\ref{fig:solveA}).

\noindent After being routed to Process~C by intermediary processes (see
Figure~\ref{fig:solveB}), $\alpha$ reaches Process~C (see
Figure~\ref{fig:solveC}).  Process~C starts to register messages it delivers in
a buffer $B_\alpha$.  Process~C acknowledges the receipt of $\alpha$ by sending
a second control message $\beta$ to Process~B using safe links (see
Line~\ref{line:sendbeta}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveC}, Process~C broadcasts
$c_1$ and registers it in $B_\alpha$.

\noindent After being routed to Process~B (see Figure~\ref{fig:solveD}), $\beta$
reaches Process~B. Process~B starts to register messages it delivers in a buffer
$B_\beta$. Process~B sends a third control message $\pi$ to Process~C using safe
links (see Line~\ref{line:sendpi}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveE}, Process~B delivers
$c_1$ then broadcasts $b_1$. It registers them in $B_\beta$. In Figure~\ref{fig:solveF},
Process~C broadcasts $c_2$ and registers it in $B_\alpha$.

\noindent After being routed to Process~C by intermediary processes (see
Figure~\ref{fig:solveF}), $\pi$ reaches Process~C. Process~C ends its first
buffer $B_\alpha$.  Process~C starts to register messages it delivers in
$B_\pi$.  Process~C sends a fourth and last control message $\rho$ to Process~B
using safe links (see Line~\ref{line:sendrho}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveG}
Process~C delivers $b_1$, broadcasts $c_3$, and registers them in $B_\pi$. In
the meantime, Process~B broadcasts $b_2$ and registers it in $B_\beta$.

\noindent After being routed to Process~B, $\rho$ reaches Process~B (see
Figure~\ref{fig:solveH}).  Process~B stops buffering and sends its buffer of
messages $B_\beta$ using the new link $s_{BC}(B_\beta)$ (see
Line~\ref{line:sendbuffer}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveI}, this buffer contains
$b_1$, $b_2$, and $c_2$. The new link is safe. Process~B starts to use this link
normally for causal broadcast using Algorithm~\ref{algo:reliablebroadcast}.

\noindent Once Process~C receives the buffer, it ends its buffer $B_\pi$ (see
Figure~\ref{fig:solveI}). Using $B_\alpha$, and $B_\pi$, Process~C identifies
among messages from $B_\beta$ the array of messages to deliver (see
Line~\ref{line:todeliver}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveJ}, this array only includes
$b_2$.  Using $B_\alpha$, and $B_\pi$, Process~C also identifies the set of
messages to ignore which is the rest of the buffer. In Figure~\ref{fig:solveJ},
this set includes $c_1$, $b_1$ and $c_2$. Finally, Process~C identifies among its own
delivered messages the messages to expect from Process~B (see
Line~\ref{line:toexpect}). In Figure~\ref{fig:solveJ}, this set includes $c_3$.
This set constitutes the memory of the new safe link.  Afterwards, messages
received by this new link are processed normally.


\RPCBROADCAST builds link memory using control messages that acknowledges the
delivery of preceding messages. Every process safely removes obsolete control
information about past broadcast messages.  The size of the local structure
increases and decreases over receipts.  In the next section, we analyze the
complexity of this causal broadcast implementation.

\subsection{Complexity}
\label{subsec:complexity}

In this section, we analyze the complexity of \RPCBROADCAST in terms of
broadcast message overhead, delivery execution time, local space consumption,
and number of control messages.

\noindent The \textbf{broadcast message overhead} is constant $O(1)$. The
protocol uses reliable FIFO links to transmit messages.

\noindent The \textbf{delivery execution time}, i.e., the time complexity of the
receipt function is $O(|Q_i|)$.  The protocol checks and updates control
information associated to each link in the in-view $Q_i$. The size of in-views
can be much smaller than the number of processes in the system $|P|$. For
instance, peer-sampling approaches~\cite{ganesh2001scamp,nedelec2017adaptive}
provides every process with an in-view the size of which is logarithmically
scaling with the number of processes $O(\ln(|P|))$.

\noindent The \textbf{local space consumption} depends on the size of buffers
and the size of the in-view. Each link in the in-view has its buffer of control
information about messages. A message appears in the structure after its first
receipt and disappears at its last receipt. So the local space complexity is
$O(|Q_i| \cdot M)$ where $M$ is the number of messages already delivered that
will be received again from at least a link in the in-view $Q_i$. 
The local space consumption depends on system settings (e.g. processes do not
consume space when the system topology is a ring or a tree) and use
(e.g. processes do not consume space when no process broadcasts any message).

\noindent The overhead in terms of \textbf{number of control messages} per added
link in an out-view varies from $6$ to $4 \cdot |P|^2$ depending on the overlay
network; $P$ being the set of processes currently in the system. It achieves $6$
messages when Process~A adds Process~B using Process~C as mediator, and
Process~B has Process~A in its out-view.  It achieves $8$ control messages when
peer-sampling protocols build out-views using neighbor-to-neighbor
interactions~\cite{jelasity2007gossip,nedelec2017adaptive}. It achieves
$O(4 \cdot \log(|P|))$ control messages when peer-sampling protocols allows
processes to route their messages~\cite{jelasity2009tman,stoica2001chord}.  It
achieves $O(4 \cdot |P|^2)$ control messages when Process~A adds Process~B
without knowledge of any route. Process~A and Process~B fall back to reliable
broadcast instead of routing to disseminate control messages.

This complexity analysis shows that \RPCBROADCAST proposes a novel trade-off in
terms of complexity. In systems allowing a form of routing, processes only send
a few control messages to handle dynamicity. Every process maintains a local
structure the size of which increases and decreases over receipts. Every process
safely removes obsolete control information about past messages. It constitutes
an advantageous trade-off that depends on the actual system settings and use
instead of past deliveries. The next section describes an experiment
highlighting the effects of the system settings on the space consumed by
processes.
