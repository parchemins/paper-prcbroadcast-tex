\label{sec:conclusion}


In this paper, we proposed an original causal broadcast protocol that removes
the last linear and monotonic upper bound that remained on local space
complexity. Our approach exploits causal order brought by causal broadcast to
improve the underlying reliable broadcast. The local space complexity depends on
the system and its usage. The overhead in terms of number of control messages
depends on the dynamicity of the system and remains low upon the assumption that
the overlay network allows a form of routing.
% Processes pay at the height of
% their usage.
% This approach only uses buffers of messages that grow and shrink when
% processes add new neighbors. They eventually become empty when the system
% becomes static. To achieve this, our approach only uses small control messages
% of constant size. The number of control messages depends on the overlay
% network. Using routing strategies, this number remains small, hence generated
% traffic overhead remains small.
This advantageous tradeoff makes causal broadcast a lightweight and efficient
middleware for group communication in distributed systems. This advantageous
tradeoff even makes \RPCBROADCAST a lightweight and efficient implementation for
reliable broadcast. %As consequence, causal broadcast and reliable broadcast can
%run in large and dynamic systems even on most humble devices such as Raspberry
%Piâ€™s.

As future work, we plan to investigate on ways to retrieve the partial order of
messages out of \RPCBROADCAST. Using \RPCBROADCAST, each process experiences a
flatten version of the partial order. However, several applications (\REF)
require more than causal order, they also need to identify concurrent
messages. \RPCBROADCAST discards a lot of information by ignoring multiple
receipts altogether. Analyzing the receipt order could provide insight on the
partial order. Instead of using vector clocks the cost of which increases with
the number of processes that ever broadcast, the cost could depend on the actual
concurrency of the system.
